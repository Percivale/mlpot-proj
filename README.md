# A Machine Learning Potential for Amorphous Alumina in LAMMPS

# The Matsui Potential
This potential was developed by M. Matsui and published in 1994, "A transferable interatomic potential model for crystals and melts in the system CaO-MgO-$Al_2O_3$-$SiO_2$. The potential is,

$
\begin{equation}
    V(\Vec{r_{ij}}) = \frac{q_i q_j}{\Vec{r_{ij}}} - 
\end{equation}
